== RosaeNLG Project Proposal

*Name of project*: RosaeNLG

*Requested project maturity level*: Incubation

=== Project description

NLG automates the production of relatively repetitive texts based on structured input data and textual templates. Typical usecases are describing a product based on its features (SEO), produce structured reports (e.g. risk reports or fund performance in the financial industry), or generate well formed chatbot answers.

NLG is widespread in large corporations, especially in the financial industry.

RosaeNLG is an open source Natural Language Generation (NLG) project. It aims to offer the same NLG features as product NLG solutions, to be developer and IT friendly for template configuration, and to provide NLG on both server-side and browser-side.


=== Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission

NLG is a brick to *build business services directly aimed at final users*. It is widely used in the industry.

NLG concurs to *democratization and understandability of AI*:

* Non-expert users don’t understand figures and dashboards and prefer textual explanations
* Computer-generated texts can be superior (from the reader's perspective) to human-written texts
* NLG is used to generate value from data: typically at the end of an AI pipeline, to *automate and convey expertise, explain and summarize situations*, and communicate with end users
* Bring *thrusted AI*, typically in collaboration with https://ai-explainability-360.org/[AI Explainability 360] and http://aif360.mybluemix.net/[AI Fairness 360]

RosaeNLG project will also:

* Increase diversity: first *French originated* project
* Foster usage, contributions and diversity in *NLG domain*, supporting languages presently not covered by any NLG system


=== Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects

RosaeNLG currently runs on Acumos for Orange AI Marketplace.

RosaeNLG can be used at the end of the AI pipeline, to *explain a decision* to non-experts:

* https://ai-explainability-360.org/[AI Explainability 360]: provide a clear, readable, summarized explanation for an end user (e.g. Bank Customer) asking for explanations
* http://aif360.mybluemix.net/[AI Fairness 360]: generate comprehensive compliance reports on fairness (initial situation, what was done, final situation)
