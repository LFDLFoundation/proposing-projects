# Hosting Projects under the LF AI Foundation 
This repo contains the <a href="https://github.com/lfai/proposing-projects/blob/master/process%20and%20lifecylce/LF%20AI%20Project%20Process%20and%20Lifecycle%2009032019.pdf">LF AI Project Proposal Process and Lifecycle Document</a> that explains the process to host new projects in the LF AI Foundation. It is your starting point to learn the various project stages, the process to follow to propose hosting a new project, the lifecycle of how a project transitions between stages, in addition to the benefits of being an LF AI hosted project. 
This repo also includes a <a href="https://github.com/lfai/proposing-projects/blob/master/proposal-template.adoc">template</a> that we recommend you use when making such a proposal. We also make available copies of <a href="https://github.com/lfai/proposing-projects/tree/master/proposals">previous proposals</a> for your referenece. 

For any questions, please contact the LF AI staff via info@lfai.foundation.

# Incubation Stage Requirements

To be accepted to at the Incubation stage, a project must:

<ul>
<li> The project uses an OSI-approved open source license
<li> The project does not have dependencies on components that are either proprietary or licensed under a non OSI-approved license
<li> Submit a completed Project Contribution Proposal to the TAC via a Github pull request (https://github.com/lfai/proposing-projects/tree/master/proposals) along with a short and a short email notification to info@lfai.foundation
<li> Provide such additional information as the TAC or GB may reasonably request
<li> Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions
<li> Have a healthy number of committers. A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept contributions to some or all of the project
<li> Be deemed by the TAC and GB to add value to the artificial intelligence, machine learning and/or deep learning space and to fall within the mission and scope of LF AI
<li> Agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to The Linux Foundation or its affiliate, LF Projects, LLC, and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones. In the case of projects with established trademarks where a trademark transfer is difficult, we generally recommend the project begin operations under a new name. Note that no patent or copyright assignment is necessary in order for a project to join LF AI effort
</ul>

# Graduation Stage Requirements

To be accepted to the Graduation stage, a project must meet the Incubation stage requirements plus:
<ul>
<li>Have a healthy number of committers from at least two organizations*.
<li>Have achieved and maintained a <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en">Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge</a>.
<li>Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions*.
<li>Document current project owners and current and emeritus committers in OWNERS.md and COMMITTERS.md files.  A copy of the projectâ€™s charter (or other authorized governance document) shall be included or linked to in a GOVERNANCE.md or in a similar file. 
<li>Have a technical lead appointed for representation of the project to the TAC.
<li>Receive the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the TAC and the affirmative vote of the Governing Board.
</ul>

*Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on the type, scope and size of a project, the TAC has final judgment over the level of activity that is adequate to meet these criteria.
